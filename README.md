# 555-LED-Chaser
Mini board with flashing lights I followed the Blinky guide on Blueprint, but customised the board shape to the shape of Pakistan. I also added a crescent and star as my art. This is my first project in Blueprint, but also my first hardware project. I used this project so I could follow the other Blueprint guides.
